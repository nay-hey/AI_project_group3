Tetris Gameplay - Score Optimization

Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris in Python using the Pygame library. Additionally, a basic AI has been included to play the game automatically. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate geometric shapes, called tetrominoes, as they fall from the top of the game board to build horizontal lines without any gaps.

Play rules
Just like classical Tetris Game. You use up key to rotate a shape, left key to move left and right key to move right. Also you can use space key to drop down current shape immediately. If you want a pause, just press P key. The right panel shows the next shape.

AI Gameplay
The included simple AI is programmed to move the tetromino to the left until it encounters an obstacle, then it rotates the tetromino. If there's still an obstruction, it moves the tetromino to the right. This process repeats during the AI's gameplay.
